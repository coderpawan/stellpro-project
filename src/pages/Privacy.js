          This Privacy Policy explains what information belonging to you will be
          collected and used by Demdee.pro (“Demdee.pro,” “we,” “us,” or “our”)
          when you access our website located at https://www.Demdee.pro, the
          mobile applications available on Google Play provided by us (the
          “Apps”), and other services (collectively, together with the website
          and the Apps, therein called our “Service”). We will not use or share
          your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy
          Policy. Each time you use our Service, you are accepting the practices
          described in this Privacy Policy at that time. The Demdee.pro Website
          is intended for adults only and does not allow any form of gameplay.
          The Apps downloaded to your device allow gameplay and are intended for
          families and users across all age groups. Please read this policy in
          its entirety, including our Children’s Privacy Policy section, before
          using our Services. The Children’s Privacy Policy will control over
          any conflicting provisions in our general Privacy Policy as it
          concerns children’s data.

          Demdee.pro also makes certain choices available to you when it comes
          to your personal data. Please review the below information outlining
          your choices and how to exercise them.

          Review and Update Your Data
        </div>
        <div className="">
          You have the right to access and update any personal data that we have
          collected. Some personal data, such as the account holder’s name,
          email address and phone number can be found and updated using the
          account setting tool on our website at https://www.Demdee.pro. For any
          personal data beyond this, please submit a request using the contact
          information provided below. We may request more information to confirm
          your identity before modifying any personal data. If you want to
          ensure the complete removal of your data, send us an email, requesting
          for the same at hello@Demdee.pro.

        <div className="my-1 text-xl font-bold">Restrict Processing</div>
        <div className="">
          You have the right to restrict how we process your personal data in
          certain circumstances. In some ways, this is an alternative to
          requesting the erasure of your data. Rather than requesting we erase
          all of your personal data, you may request that we limit our uses of
          your personal data to specific purposes. You may wish to request we
          restrict our processing if you contest the accuracy of your personal
          data and we are working to verify this information, or if you want us
          to retain your personal data in connection to a legal claim but cease
          processing it.

        <div className="my-1 text-xl font-bold">Data Portability</div>
        <div className="">
          You have the right to obtain copies of your information in a
          structured, commonly used format that you can move your data between
          our service and the services of others. We may request more
          information to confirm your identity before providing any personal
          data.
        </div>
        <div className="my-1 text-xl font-bold">Right to Object</div>
        <div className="">
          You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data
          for direct marketing purposes or when our processing of your data is
          based on legitimate interests. You may request that we stop processing
          your personal data for direct marketing purposes. This is an absolute
          right and we cannot refuse this request. Beyond direct marketing, if
          you wish to exercise this right, you must give specific reasons why
          you object to our processing of your data, based on your particular
          situation. Even after receiving such a request, we may continue
          processing if it is necessary for the exercise/defense of a legal
          claim or if we can demonstrate a compelling legitimate ground for the
          processing. If any request made under this section is manifestly
          unfounded or excessive, we may reject the request or require a
          reasonable fee to honor the request. If we decide to reject your
          request, we will inform you of the reasons for not taking action and
          provide information on other possible remedies. If we decide that a
          reasonable fee is necessary, we will promptly inform you and will
          comply with the request upon receipt of this fee.

        <div className="">
          Protecting the privacy of children is especially important. The
          Demdee.pro website is not intended for children, does not market to
          children, and does not knowingly collect personal information from
          children. All references to “children” or “child” in this Children’s
          Privacy Policy shall mean children under 16 years of age, and all
          references to the term “parent” shall include legal guardians. Inside
          the Play Experience, all play is locally stored, and no Personal
          Information is collected or solicited from a child user. Our Play
          Experience contains no external links to third party websites or
          services. The Demdee.pro Experience is directed at users of all ages,
          including children. We encourage parents and teachers to supervise
          their child or student’s use of the Apps and supervise the overall
          Demdee.pro Experience. Simply downloading any Demdee.pro App to your
          device does not trigger the collection of any personally identifiable
          information. We only collect information essential for installing
          necessary administrative updates to your device (such as software
          updates and administrative messages). We may collect analytics data
          (which does not contain Personal Information) from your use of the
          Service in order to offer and develop the Service, and we may collect
          information such as age and nickname from you as part of your use of
          the Apps and the Service and the creation of your user profile. If the
          Service is being used by a school and/or teacher (the “Educational
          Institution”) with students that are under 16 years of age, such
          Educational Institution agrees that it has reviewed our Terms of Use
          and our Privacy Policy. Demdee.pro only requests Personal Information
          from parents and/or teachers and we will never knowingly solicit, nor
          will we accept, Personal Information from users known to be under 16
          years of age. We collect only the minimum amount of information needed
          about students from teachers, and any such information is used only in
          connection with the Educational Institution’s use of the Demdee.pro
          Experience. If you are under 16 years of age, then please do not use
          or access the Website at any time or in any manner. If we learn that
          personally identifiable information has been provided to us and/or
          collected on the Website from persons under 16 years of age and
          without verifiable parental consent, such as through a support
          request, we take the appropriate steps to delete or hash this
          information in a secure manner. If you are a parent and discover that
          your child under 16 years of age has obtained an account on the
          Website, then you may alert us at hello@Demdee.pro and request that we
          delete that child’s personally identifiable information from our
          systems. A parent or teacher can visit his or her account online at
          any time to delete any information and/or the account.

          Updates to Our Privacy Policy
        </div>
        <div className="">
          We reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy from time to time.
          When we do, we will revise the “Effective Date” at the top of this
          Privacy Policy. We encourage you to check this page periodically for
          any updates. If you continue to use the Service following the posting
          of an updated version of this Privacy Policy, we will treat your
          continued use as acceptance of the updated version. If we make
          material changes to this Privacy Policy, we may notify you more
          prominently. If we affect the way we handle Personal Information
          collected from children users (if applicable), we will first notify
          and obtain the verifiable consent of a parent or legal guardian.
