          You have the right to restrict how we process your personal data in
          certain circumstances. In some ways, this is an alternative to
          requesting the erasure of your data. Rather than requesting we erase
          all of your personal data, you may request that we limit our uses of
          your personal data to specific purposes. You may wish to request we
          restrict our processing if you contest the accuracy of your personal
          data and we are working to verify this information, or if you want us
          to retain your personal data in connection to a legal claim but cease

          right and we cannot refuse this request. Beyond direct marketing, if
          you wish to exercise this right, you must give specific reasons why
          you object to our processing of your data, based on your particular
          situation. Even after receiving such a request, we may continue
          processing if it is necessary for the exercise/defense of a legal
          claim or if we can demonstrate a compelling legitimate ground for the
          processing. If any request made under this section is manifestly
          unfounded or excessive, we may reject the request or require a
          reasonable fee to honor the request. If we decide to reject your

          reasonable fee is necessary, we will promptly inform you and will
          comply with the request upon receipt of this fee.

        <div className="">
          Protecting the privacy of children is especially important. The
          StellPro learning website is not intended for children, does not
          market to children, and does not knowingly collect personal
          information from children. All references to “children” or “child” in
          this Children’s Privacy Policy shall mean children under 16 years of
          age, and all references to the term “parent” shall include legal
          guardians. Inside the Play Experience, all play is locally stored, and
          no Personal Information is collected or solicited from a child user.
          Our Play Experience contains no external links to third party websites
          or services. The StellPro learning Experience is directed at users of
          all ages, including children. We encourage parents and teachers to
          supervise their child or student’s use of the Apps and supervise the
          overall StellPro learning Experience. Simply downloading any StellPro
          learning App to your device does not trigger the collection of any
          personally identifiable information. We only collect information
          essential for installing necessary administrative updates to your
          device (such as software updates and administrative messages). We may
          collect analytics data (which does not contain Personal Information)
          from your use of the Service in order to offer and develop the
          Service, and we may collect information such as age and nickname from
          you as part of your use of the Apps and the Service and the creation
          of your user profile. If the Service is being used by a school and/or
          teacher (the “Educational Institution”) with students that are under
          16 years of age, such Educational Institution agrees that it has
          reviewed our Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy. StellPro learning
          only requests Personal Information from parents and/or teachers and we
          will never knowingly solicit, nor will we accept, Personal Information
          from users known to be under 16 years of age. We collect only the
          minimum amount of information needed about students from teachers, and
          any such information is used only in connection with the Educational
          Institution’s use of the StellPro learning Experience. If you are
          under 16 years of age, then please do not use or access the Website at
          any time or in any manner. If we learn that personally identifiable
          information has been provided to us and/or collected on the Website
          from persons under 16 years of age and without verifiable parental
          consent, such as through a support request, we take the appropriate
          steps to delete or hash this information in a secure manner. If you
          are a parent and discover that your child under 16 years of age has
          obtained an account on the Website, then you may alert us at
          connect@demdee.com and request that we delete that child’s personally
          identifiable information from our systems. A parent or teacher can
          visit his or her account online at any time to delete any information
          and/or the account.

        <div className="">
          We reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy from time to time.
          When we do, we will revise the “Effective Date” at the top of this
          Privacy Policy. We encourage you to check this page periodically for
          any updates. If you continue to use the Service following the posting
          of an updated version of this Privacy Policy, we will treat your
          continued use as acceptance of the updated version. If we make
          material changes to this Privacy Policy, we may notify you more
          prominently. If we affect the way we handle Personal Information
          collected from children users (if applicable), we will first notify
          and obtain the verifiable consent of a parent or legal guardian.
