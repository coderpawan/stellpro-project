          intended to be used only by parents, legal guardians and/or teachers
          over the age of 18. In order to access certain features of the
          Services and to post any User Content on or through the Services, a
          parent, legal guardian or teacher must register to create an account
          (“Account”) on the Website/Application. By creating an Account, you
          represent and warrant that you are at least 18 years of age.
          Enabl.care reserves the right to suspend or terminate your Account if
          any information provided during the registration process or thereafter
          proves to be inaccurate, not current or incomplete. It is your
          responsibility not to disclose your Account credentials to anyone. You
          will immediately notify Enabl.care of any unauthorized use of your
          Account.

          under 13 years of age.

          students that are under 18 years of age uses our Services and provides
          us with personally identifiable information about its students in

          must first obtain written consent from each student’s parent and/or
          legal guardian to submit such personally identifiable information to
          us and use such personally identifiable information in the Services.
          We use that information to provide the Services to the Educational
          Institution, consistent with our Privacy Policy. Each Educational

        <div className="">
          Protecting the privacy of children is especially important. The
          Demdee.pro website is not intended for children, does not market to
          children, and does not knowingly collect personal information from
          children. All references to “children” or “child” in this Children’s
          Privacy Policy shall mean children under 16 years of age, and all
          references to the term “parent” shall include legal guardians. Inside
          the Play Experience, all play is locally stored, and no Personal
          Information is collected or solicited from a child user. Our Play
          Experience contains no external links to third party websites or
          services. The Demdee.pro Experience is directed at users of all ages,
          including children. We encourage parents and teachers to supervise
          their child or student’s use of the Apps and supervise the overall
          Demdee.pro Experience. Simply downloading any Demdee.pro App to your
          device does not trigger the collection of any personally identifiable
          information. We only collect information essential for installing
          necessary administrative updates to your device (such as software
          updates and administrative messages). We may collect analytics data
          (which does not contain Personal Information) from your use of the
          Service in order to offer and develop the Service, and we may collect
          information such as age and nickname from you as part of your use of
          the Apps and the Service and the creation of your user profile. If the
          Service is being used by a school and/or teacher (the “Educational
          Institution”) with students that are under 16 years of age, such
          Educational Institution agrees that it has reviewed our Terms of Use
          and our Privacy Policy. Demdee.pro only requests Personal Information
          from parents and/or teachers and we will never knowingly solicit, nor
          will we accept, Personal Information from users known to be under 16
          years of age. We collect only the minimum amount of information needed
          about students from teachers, and any such information is used only in
          connection with the Educational Institution’s use of the Demdee.pro
          Experience. If you are under 16 years of age, then please do not use
          or access the Website at any time or in any manner. If we learn that
          personally identifiable information has been provided to us and/or
          collected on the Website from persons under 16 years of age and
          without verifiable parental consent, such as through a support
          request, we take the appropriate steps to delete or hash this
          information in a secure manner. If you are a parent and discover that
          your child under 16 years of age has obtained an account on the
          Website, then you may alert us at hello@Demdee.pro and request that we
          delete that child’s personally identifiable information from our
          systems. A parent or teacher can visit his or her account online at
          any time to delete any information and/or the account.

          When we do, we will revise the “Effective Date” at the top of this

          any updates. If you continue to use the Service following the posting
          of an updated version of this Privacy Policy, we will treat your
          continued use as acceptance of the updated version. If we make
          material changes to this Privacy Policy, we may notify you more
          prominently. If we affect the way we handle Personal Information
          collected from children users (if applicable), we will first notify
